One of them is the main page through which you can visit the other pages. On the top right corner 
three list items of an unordered list are present which can be used to move to other pages. Different types
of css selectors are used to style specific elements. 

  The main page of the website consists some paragraph and heading elements and a picture to represent 
basic information.

  The second page consists of the characters and a grid model is used to represent them in the form of table.
  Media query is also used to make the web page responsive especially for mobile screens.

   The third page consists of the quotes by characters for which Blockquote element along with bootstrap 
   is used to style the quotes. Media query is also used to make the web page responsive especially for mobile screens.

 compiled with style2.scss. 

On the third page a form is designed for user to enter their information which is further styled using
