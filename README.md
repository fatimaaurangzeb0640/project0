  This is a website for all the money heist fans out there. It basically consists of four html pages.
  One of them is the main page through which you can visit the other pages. On the top right corner 
  three list items of an unordered list are present which can be used to move to other pages. On all the 
  pages other than main pages, on the top left corner, a link has been provided to go back to the main page.
  Different types of css selectors and properties are used to style specific elements. 

  Index.html is the main page of the website which consists of some paragraph and heading elements and a picture to represent 
  basic information. The layout of the page has been created by using div element and float property.

  The second page i.e. characters.html consists of the characters, their picture and description and bootstrap grid model 
  is used to represent them in the form of table. 

  The third page i.e quotes.html consists of the quotes by characters for which Blockquote element along with bootstrap classes 
  are used to style the quotes. 
  Note: Index.html, quotes.html, characters.html use style.css while joinus.html is connected with style2.css which is 
  compiled with style2.scss. 

  Finally, on the fourth page i.e joinus.html a form is designed for user to enter their information which is further styled using 
  bootstrap classes and a table is included below for relevant information. 
  
  All of the pages are made responsive using media query.
