    <h2>Upcoming Season</h2>
        <p>
          At the moment, Money Heist season five hasn't technically been greenlit, 
          but as one of the most popular Netflix series in the world – it was 
          ranked #2 in the UK on April 6 – it's unlikely that the streamer would 
          pull the plug just yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking to ABC Spain, creator Álex Pina insinuated that discussions 
          are happening, although no details have been officially released: 
          "Someone knows there will be [a fifth season], but we don't."
        </p>
        

    <h2 class="fans">What do fans want?</h2>
    <p>
        In the Spanish Netflix drama about a bank heist, Arturo is seen giving
        a woman four pills to help calm her nerves, before taking her to the 
        side of the bank to sleep. The much-talked about incident then happens
        as she's passed out, before she wakes up screaming that she's been raped.
        But Arturo, who is the Director of the Royal Mint of Spain, denies this
        and instead claims the victim is just groggy from the pills she's taken.
    </p>
    <p>
        "I think we can all agree that Arturo in Money Heist is without a 
        doubt the worst character in existence," said one Twitter user.
    </p>
    <p>
       While another added: "The real villain in Money Heist (La Casa De Papel)
       is not Alicia Sierra, not Alfonso Prieto but, its the f****** rapist, 
       Arturo Roman.
    </p>
    <p>"I wanna burn him alive."
        One disgusted fan requested: "Arturo, please just die on the episode 1
        of Money Heist part 4.</p>

    <ol class="plans"> <h2> List of plans </h2> </ol>
    <li> Plan Valencia : Make the police doubt the safety of hostages, so they ask for a proof of their lives, to waste time. </li>
    <li> Plan Cameroon : Win the public's empathy. </li>
    <li> Plan Chernobyl: Send euro bills in balloons and pop them in the air to make a huge mess and escape in it. </li>
   
    <h2>Up next?</h2>
    <p id="upnext">
      Police inspector Alicia Sierra is known for her pure hatred of the gang committing the heists.
      However, it was only in episode four of season four when viewers found out more about her life - and her mystery husband.
      She has revealed that her husband, called German, died of cancer.
      Although we don't know exactly who he is, we have some fan theories - and they think it's Berlin.
      They believe the fact that he's called 'German' signals that he is Berlin.
      We also know that Berlin is dying of a mysterious disease in the show.
      Hopefully season 5 will shed some light on who he is.
      In a tense interrogation scene with Lisbon where she revealed her husband German had died of cancer she said: “He’s dead. "Cancer of the pancreas. The kind where they tell you you have two months and it’s two months.
      “I was getting fat, he was getting thin. I was pink and he was yellow. It consumed him.
      “Life grew inside me and death grew in him. But I guess that’s cancer.
      “Do you know the last thing he said to me? Can you believe his last words were 'turn on the news.'"
